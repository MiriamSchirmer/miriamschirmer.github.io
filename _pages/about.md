I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [LINK Lab](https://link.soc.northwestern.edu/about-us/) at Northwestern University and an affiliated postdoctoral researcher at the [Computational Social Science Lab](https://www.hfp.tum.de/css/startseite/) at the Technical University of Munich, where I received my Ph.D. in 2024. 

My expertise lies in developing computational approaches to operationalize and understand complex and potentially harmful phenomena, such as **misinformation, violent language, and abuse online**. I do this by applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze large-scale text data, identify patterns, and uncover nuanced insights that inform interventions and policy-making.
I hold undergraduate degrees in Psychology, Political Science, and History, and a master’s degree in Criminology.

I am currently on the academic job market.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

About Me
------

If I were to visit your city, you'd find me exploring a local bookshop for my next book club pick, then settling into a cozy coffee shop or joining a salsa or bachata social.

I'm one of the deputy chairs at [Genocide Alert](https://www.genocide-alert.de/about/), a German human rights organization that advocates for the effective prevention and punishment of grave human rights violations such as genocide and crimes against humanity.
