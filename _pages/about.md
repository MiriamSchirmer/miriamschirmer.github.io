<br>
I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [LINK Lab](https://link.soc.northwestern.edu/about-us/) at Northwestern University.

My expertise lies in developing computational approaches to analyze complex and potentially harmful phenomena, such as **misinformation, violent language, and abuse online**. I do this by applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze large-scale text data, identify patterns, and uncover insights that inform interventions and policy-making.

I received my Ph.D. from Technical University of Munich, where I was advised by J√ºrgen Pfeffer ([Computational Social Science Lab](https://www.hfp.tum.de/css/startseite/)). I hold undergraduate degrees in Psychology, Political Science, and History, and a master‚Äôs degree in Criminology.

During my PhD, I have also been a visiting researcher at University of Michigan, University of Cambridge, and the Auschwitz Insitute for the Prevention of Mass Atrocities in New York City.

About Me
------

If I were to visit your city, you'd find me exploring a local bookshop for my next book club pick, then settling into a cozy coffee shop, or joining a salsa or bachata social.

I'm one of the deputy chairs at [Genocide Alert](https://www.genocide-alert.de/about/), a German human rights organization that advocates for the effective prevention and punishment of grave human rights violations such as genocide and crimes against humanity.

My work and studies have been supported by the [German Academic Scholarship Foundation](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/), the [German Business Foundation](https://www.sdw.org), and the [Bavarian Research Institute for Digital Transformation](https://en.bidt.digital).
