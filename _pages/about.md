I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [LINK Lab](https://link.soc.northwestern.edu/about-us/) at Northwestern University and an affiliated postdoctoral researcher at the [Computational Social Science Lab](https://www.hfp.tum.de/css/startseite/) at the Technical University of Munich, where I received my Ph.D. in 2024. 
My expertise lies in developing computational approaches to operationalize and understand complex and potentially harmful phenomena, such as **misinformation, violent language, and abuse online**. I do this by applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze large-scale text data, identify patterns, and uncover nuanced insights that inform interventions and policy-making.
I hold undergraduate degrees in Psychology, Political Science, and History, and a master’s degree in Criminology.
Please reach out, if you're interested in collaborating!

About Me
------

If I were to visit your city, you'd find me exploring a local bookshop for my next book club pick, then settling into a cozy coffee shop or joining a salsa or bachata social.

I'm one of the deputy chairs at [Genocide Alert](https://www.genocide-alert.de/about/), a German human rights organization that advocates for the effective prevention and punishment of grave human rights violations such as genocide and crimes against humanity.
