<br>
I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [LINK Lab](https://link.soc.northwestern.edu/about-us/) at Northwestern University and an affiliated postdoctoral researcher at the [Computational Social Science Lab](https://www.hfp.tum.de/css/startseite/) at the Technical University of Munich, where I received my Ph.D. in 2024. 

My expertise lies in developing computational approaches to operationalize and understand complex and potentially harmful phenomena, such as **misinformation, violent language, and abuse online**. I do this by applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze large-scale text data, identify patterns, and uncover nuanced insights that inform interventions and policy-making.
I hold undergraduate degrees in Psychology, Political Science, and History, and a master‚Äôs degree in Criminology.

About Me
------

If I were to visit your city, you'd find me exploring a local bookshop for my next book club pick, then settling into a cozy coffee shop, or joining a salsa or bachata social.

I'm one of the deputy chairs at [Genocide Alert](https://www.genocide-alert.de/about/), a German human rights organization that advocates for the effective prevention and punishment of grave human rights violations such as genocide and crimes against humanity.

My work and studies have been supported by the [German Academic Scholarship Foundation](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/), the [German Business Foundation](https://www.sdw.org), and the [Bavarian Research Institute for Digital Transformation](https://en.bidt.digital).
